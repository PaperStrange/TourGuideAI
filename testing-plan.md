# TourGuideAI - Phase 4 Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for verifying all components, functionality, and interactive requirements of the TourGuideAI application as part of Phase 4: Production Integration.

## Testing Approach
We will use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing to ensure all aspects of the application are working correctly.

## Core API Testing

2. **generateRandomRoute (user_route_generate_randomly)**
   - ✅ Should generate a random route
   - ✅ Should include diverse destination types
   - ✅ Should handle API errors gracefully

3. **recognizeTextIntent**
   - ✅ Should extract intent from user queries
   - ✅ Should identify destination, dates, and preferences
   - ✅ Should handle ambiguous queries

4. **splitRouteByDay (user_route_split_by_day)**
   - ✅ Should split routes into daily itineraries
   - ✅ Should balance activities across days
   - ✅ Should respect time constraints

### Google Maps API Functions
1. **displayRouteOnMap (map_real_time_display)**
   - ✅ Should render routes on a map
   - ✅ Should display waypoints accurately
   - ✅ Should handle map rendering errors

2. **getNearbyInterestPoints (get nearby interest point api)**
   - ✅ Should find points of interest near each route stop
   - ✅ Should return relevant details (name, address, ratings)
   - ✅ Should filter by distance and relevance

3. **validateTransportation (user_route_transportation_validation)**
   - ✅ Should verify transportation times and distances
   - ✅ Should update routes with accurate information
   - ✅ Should handle various transportation methods

4. **validateInterestPoints (user_route_interest_points_validation)**
   - ✅ Should verify distances between points
   - ✅ Should filter out points that are too far
   - ✅ Should handle API errors gracefully

## Storage Services Testing

### LocalStorageService
1. **Basic Storage Operations**

   - ✅ Should handle invalid JSON data
   - ✅ Should remove data correctly

2. **Route Operations**
   - ✅ Should save and retrieve routes
   - ✅ Should get all routes
   - ✅ Should handle route updates

3. **Timeline Operations**
   - ✅ Should save and retrieve timelines
   - ✅ Should link timelines to routes

4. **Favorites and Settings**
   - ✅ Should manage user favorites
   - ✅ Should save and retrieve user settings

### CacheService
1. **Cache Management**
   - ✅ Should cache and retrieve routes
   - ✅ Should handle cache expiration
   - ✅ Should clean up expired entries

2. **Version Control**
   - ✅ Should check and update cache version
   - ✅ Should clear cache on version change

3. **Cache Size Monitoring**
   - ✅ Should track cache size
   - ✅ Should handle cache limits
   - ✅ Should remove oldest entries when cache is full

### SyncService
1. **Synchronization**
   - ✅ Should queue items for sync
   - ✅ Should sync with server
   - ✅ Should handle sync failures

2. **Periodic Sync**
   - ✅ Should perform periodic sync
   - ✅ Should track sync progress

## Route Services Testing

### RouteService
1. **Ranking and Sorting (rank_route)**
   - ✅ Should sort routes by different criteria (created_date, upvotes, views, sites, cost)
   - ✅ Should support ascending and descending order
   - ✅ Should handle missing fields gracefully
   - ✅ Should retrieve and rank routes from storage

2. **Statistics Calculation (route_statics)**
   - ✅ Should calculate route statistics accurately
   - ✅ Should count sites in route
   - ✅ Should determine duration from route data
   - ✅ Should estimate costs based on duration and sites
   - ✅ Should handle routes with missing data

## UI Component Testing

### TimelineComponent
   - ✅ Should render timeline with correct days
   - ✅ Should display all locations
   - ✅ Should show transportation details
   - ✅ Should display recommended reasons
   - ✅ Should handle empty data gracefully

### Map Component
   - ✅ Should initialize Google Maps
   - ✅ Should render routes on the map
   - ✅ Should display points of interest
   - ✅ Should handle interaction events

### Chat Component
   - ✅ Should capture user input
   - ✅ Should process and display AI responses
   - ✅ Should show loading states during processing

## Integration Testing

### Route Generation Flow
   - ✅ Should handle the complete route generation flow:
     - User enters query
     - Intent is extracted
     - Route is generated
     - Timeline is created
     - Transportation is validated
     - Nearby points of interest are found
     - Map is updated
     - Results are cached

### Error Handling
   - ✅ Should gracefully handle API failures
   - ✅ Should provide user feedback for errors
   - ✅ Should attempt retry for transient failures
   - ✅ Should fall back to cached data when appropriate

## Test Execution Instructions

1. **Unit Tests**
   ```
   npm test
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   ```
   npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration
   ```

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Run the application with `npm start`
   - Follow the test scenarios in each section above
   - Verify visual rendering and user interaction

## Next Steps
- Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- Improve test coverage for error conditions
- Add performance testing for API response times

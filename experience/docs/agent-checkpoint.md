# Agent checkpoint · Explore and Together homepage

2026-10-15 · Lead owns integration, commits and publication.
**State: homepage and shared-room implementation in progress. New hosted frontend/backend delivery is pending.**

## Resume from saved work

- Workspace: `/workspace/TourGuideAI`; source branch: `chore-sow-delivery-plan`.
- Current milestone starts from checkpoint commit `3794918`.
- Previously released companion application: `a8c3e493058198e8e5012bc9fd470190dc358148`.
- Previous Pages: `6b5b1ea41a658badc8d364ad2267d07028b8fdbe`; publication worktree:
  `/workspace/TourGuideAI-pages`, branch `publish-travel-20261015`.
- Released companion entry: [travel.html](https://paperstrange.github.io/TourGuideAI/travel.html).
  [Review instructions](../../PREVIEW.md) and [evidence](../evidence/travel-20261015/README.md).
- Resume from the recorded release and inspect the working tree for current changes.
- Node 24.19 and dependencies are available at this checkpoint. Recheck on another
  environment rather than assuming installed tools or scratch evidence persisted.

The user authorized a homepage with Explore and Together, selected a small hosted
backend and requested synchronized commits/checkpoints. Continue that work within
the agreed scope. SOW remains initial guidance. Historical closed reviewers are
not active team members.

## Approved scope and present limits

The [homepage brief](homepage-journeys.md) defines the new release criteria:
Explore searches a real place, opens its available scene/map and suggests sourced
local stops. Together uses invitation-based rooms for participants' dream countries
or cities, a shared world map, local views and reviewed journey proposals. The
backend provides persisted room state, revision-checked edits, streamed updates
and a configured-model planning endpoint. Shared activity means intentional room
contributions and selected views; it carries no physical-location presence claim.

Building realism and day/night remain priorities. Detailed Kyoto and wider 3D-map
coverage must be labelled according to the delivered geometry. Source-informed
place order, externally computed directions and model-generated proposals retain
their different meanings. Hosted API availability and model readiness remain
pending verification; the homepage reads actual service capabilities.

The existing `travel.html` companion retains Google Maps directions, optional
manual My Maps CSV import and explicit foreground location. Its independent saved
selections/meaningful marks and old query links must remain usable. The original
Kyoto walk moves to `walk.html`; legacy `index.html?lighting=…` links must reach it.
Existing perspective and recap links keep their recipient behavior and saves.

Location starts explicitly, pauses when hidden and requires Resume when visible
again. No background tracking, stored/uploaded GPS history or automatic visit marks.
Directions represent Google-computed routes through selected places, not a person's
recorded movement. Planned places, personal significance, virtual moments and
user-reported real visits must remain distinct.

The broader **Find your own place** experiment is still proposed: continuous world
response, deliberate personal approach/pause/view, and a recipient who can inhabit
the moment. This milestone neither delivers replay nor settles emotional value.
The new search/map scope does not complete that emotional-expression experiment.
Ginza remains a separate architectural study.

## Active owners and next actions

| Owner | Current boundary | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| Lead | `src/home/` UI/map/copy/styles except room client; entries, build/CI, release | Complete integration, preserve old links, verify and publish frontend/backend identities |
| Engineering | `server/` service, persistence, planning and tests | Verify real HTTP/SSE, participant permissions, conflicts and restart persistence; document hosted configuration |
| World-content | `src/discovery/`, provider evidence and source documentation | Verify search/nearby sources, place coverage and suggested-order semantics |
| QA-release | `tests/browser-homepage.mjs` and release checks | Exercise actual two-browser room flow, EN/ZH layouts, local scenes and old-link/save preservation |
| Product-design | `src/home/room-client.js`, `docs/homepage-journeys.md`, this checkpoint | Verify actual-service client behavior, review UI/API consistency and maintain pending release state |
| Art/UX | Detailed Kyoto runtime appearance and visual review | Review matched lighting/material views and preserve geometry, camera and journey behavior |

Paths in the ownership table are relative to `experience/`. Do not edit another
owner's files; report interface conflicts to that owner. Preserve unrelated changes.

## Exact local resume and verification commands

Inspect before editing or rebuilding:

```sh
cd /workspace/TourGuideAI
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git log -3 --oneline
git diff --stat
node --version
```

Check the service and independent application. The homepage browser suite starts
an isolated real SQLite service and serves an immutable build snapshot internally;
no shared API process or preview server is required for that suite.

```sh
cd /workspace/TourGuideAI/experience/server
npm ci --cache /workspace/.npm-cache
npm test
cd /workspace/TourGuideAI/experience
npm ci --cache /workspace/.npm-cache
npm test
npm run build
export TMPDIR=/workspace/TourGuideAI/artifacts/homepage-qa/tmp
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/workspace/.cache/ms-playwright
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
EXPERIENCE_QA_CHROMIUM=/usr/bin/chromium EXPERIENCE_QA_OUTPUT=/workspace/TourGuideAI/artifacts/homepage-qa/browser node tests/browser-homepage.mjs dist
npm run test:travel -- dist
EXPERIENCE_QA_TIMEOUT=600000 npm run test:perspective -- dist
EXPERIENCE_QA_TIMEOUT=600000 npm run test:browser -- dist
cd /workspace/TourGuideAI
node iteration/tools/run-gates.mjs
```

The matching Playwright Chromium is installed at the browser path above. On a fresh
environment install it with `npm exec --cache /workspace/.npm-cache -- playwright install chromium`
using the same `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`. Coordinate GPU-heavy suites with QA.

## Current release checks

Final homepage browser evidence, source push and hosted frontend/backend verification
are pending. Keep service availability and model configuration visible; a local
room test does not establish that a Pages visitor can use Together. The lead must
record the actual deployed API URL/version, allowed frontend origin, model capability,
tested source/build identities and hosted-file comparison before marking delivery.
Do not include service secrets or participant credentials in the checkpoint.

## Previous companion release evidence

The companion passes **73/73 browser checks**, the application passes **74/74 unit
tests**, and **17/17 repository gates** pass. The final companion report is
`experience/evidence/travel-20261015/final/travel-result.json`; its package manifest
is `6a4f5b2f11d67153058305d73ffc715d3dd7bdd5c16531bd2a89b2a933fe0608`.
The original walk passes 130 checks, perspective passes 80, and focused sharing
passes 24. Their resource bindings match the final package. All 63 hosted files
match, and [CI run 38779049743](https://github.com/PaperStrange/TourGuideAI/actions/runs/38779049743)
succeeds for all three runtime jobs. That companion release has synchronized source
and Pages records.

Completed companion evidence is in `experience/evidence/travel-20261015/`, for runtime
`a8c3e49`. These results do not validate the homepage changes. Physical review covers
GPS, permission/OS sharing behavior, Google directions and My Maps import on actual
devices. The next product discussion concerns the proposed continuous exploration
and meaningful-moment experience, beyond this practical handoff.

Commit and push coherent reviewable increments; do not leave the milestone only
in scratch files or process memory. Finish with source/Pages identities and explicit
remaining limits. Simulated browser location is not a physical field trial, and
technical delivery is not acceptance of enjoyment, emotional expression or utility.

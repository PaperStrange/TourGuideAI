# TourGuideAI Phase 6 Planning: Beta Release & User Feedback - Version 0.6

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the planning process for Phase 6 of the TourGuideAI project, following the workflow defined in `.cursor/.workflows`. It builds upon previous planning documents:

- [Performance Optimization Plan](performance-optimization-plan.md) (Version 0.5)
- [Deployment Pipeline Plan](deployment-pipeline-plan.md) (Version 0.5)
- [Stability Test Plan](stability-test-plan.md)

## 2. Planning Process

This planning followed the Phase Initialization steps from the project workflow:

1. **Milestone Review**: Reviewed `.milestones` file to understand the overall project structure and Phase 6 requirements.
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Identified Phase 6 requirements for Beta Release & User Feedback.
3. **Standards Review**: Reviewed `.cursorrules` for project standards and guidelines.
4. **Lessons Review**: Examined `project.lessons.md` to avoid repeating past mistakes.
5. **Task Breakdown**: Broke down Phase 6 into logical objects and tasks.
6. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `.milestones` file with detailed descriptions for Phase 6 objects
   - Updated `.project` file with comprehensive key results for each object
   - Updated `.todos` file with specific actionable items for each key result
   - Enhanced `stability-test-plan.md` with detailed test cases for Phase 6
7. **Cross-References**: Added references between planning artifacts and tasks in `.todos` file.
8. **Lessons Documentation**: Added lessons learned during planning to `docs/project.lessons.md`.

## 3. Planning Artifacts

The following files were updated during the Phase 6 planning process:

1. `.cursor/.milestones` - Enhanced with detailed Phase 6 objects
2. `.cursor/.project` - Updated with comprehensive key results for Phase 6
3. `.cursor/.todos` - Updated with specific tasks for Phase 6 implementation
4. `docs/stability-test-plan.md` - Enhanced with detailed test cases for Phase 6
5. `docs/project.lessons.md` - Updated with Phase 6 planning lessons

## 4. Beta Program Strategy

Building upon our established foundation, the Beta Release will focus on:

1. **User Access Management**: Controlled user onboarding with JWT authentication
2. **Feedback Collection**: Multi-channel approach with structured categorization
3. **Analytics Integration**: Comprehensive journey and performance tracking
4. **Quality Control**: Robust issue tracking and resolution workflow

## 5. Development Priorities

Based on our analysis, the implementation priorities for Phase 6 are:

1. Beta Program Infrastructure (Portal, Feedback System, Analytics Dashboard)
2. User Experience Enhancement (UX Audit, Feature Implementation)
3. Analytical Capabilities (Journey Tracking, Performance Monitoring)
4. User Documentation (Guides, API Documentation, Marketing Materials)

## 6. Next Steps

With planning complete, the project is ready to proceed to the Development Process (step 2 in the workflow):

1. Execute tasks according to the priorities defined in `.todos`
2. Update documentation as work progresses
3. Regularly check for any gaps in implementation
4. Follow testing plan for each component

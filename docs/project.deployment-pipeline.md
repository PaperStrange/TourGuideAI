# TourGuideAI Deployment Pipeline

This document outlines the deployment pipeline for the TourGuideAI application, including environments, CI/CD workflow, and monitoring setup.

## 1. Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Used by developers for daily development
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Updates**: Direct code changes
- **Data**: Mock data for testing

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Testing and QA before production release
- **URL**: https://staging.tourguideai.com
- **Updates**: Automated deployments from the `develop` branch
- **Data**: Anonymized production data
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 + CloudFront

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing environment
- **URL**: https://app.tourguideai.com
- **Updates**: Automated deployments from the `main` branch
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 + CloudFront + Route53
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront

## 2. CI/CD Workflow

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

1. **Build and Test**
   - Triggered on push to `main` and `develop` branches or pull requests
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting
   - Builds the application
   - Runs unit and integration tests
   - Archives build artifacts

2. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Triggered on successful build from the `develop` branch
   - Deploys to the staging environment
   - Updates the CloudFront distribution

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Triggered on successful build from the `main` branch
   - Requires manual approval
   - Deploys to the production environment
   - Updates the CloudFront distribution

4. **Smoke Tests**
   - Runs after deployment to verify basic functionality
   - Tests critical paths in the application
   - Verifies service worker and offline functionality

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production issues

### Deployment Workflow

1. Developer merges feature branch to `develop`
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
3. Automatic deployment to staging environment
4. QA team tests on staging
5. Pull request from `develop` to `main`
6. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
7. Manual approval for production deployment
8. Automatic deployment to production environment
9. Smoke tests verify deployment

## 3. Infrastructure as Code

The application infrastructure is defined using:

- AWS CloudFormation templates for cloud resources
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines
- Configuration files for monitoring and alerting

### Key Components:

- **Frontend**: React application served from S3 and CloudFront
- **API**: Serverless functions via AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- **Database**: DynamoDB for structured data storage
- **Caching**: CloudFront and browser caching with service worker
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logs

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Alarms

The application is monitored using AWS CloudWatch with alarms for:

- API latency exceeding thresholds
- Error rates above acceptable limits
- Server CPU and memory utilization
- Abnormal API usage patterns
- Lambda function errors

### Logging Strategy

- API Gateway access logs for request tracking
- Lambda function logs for backend operations
- CloudFront logs for CDN and edge analytics
- Client-side error reporting to CloudWatch

### Response Procedure

1. CloudWatch alarm triggered
2. SNS notification sent to on-call team
3. Investigation using CloudWatch dashboards
4. Resolution via hotfix if necessary
5. Post-incident review and documentation

## 5. Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failures or critical issues:

1. Identify the issue through monitoring alerts or manual testing
2. Trigger rollback via GitHub Actions job
3. Previous build is redeployed from artifacts
4. CloudFront cache is invalidated
5. Smoke tests verify rollback
6. Investigate root cause

## 6. Security Measures

- **SSL/TLS**: All environments use HTTPS
- **AWS IAM**: Least privilege access for all services
- **API Keys**: Rotation schedule implemented
- **Secrets**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **CORS**: Proper configuration to prevent unauthorized access
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for common attack protection

## 7. Release Cadence

- **Staging**: Continuous deployment throughout development
- **Production**: Biweekly scheduled releases
- **Hotfixes**: As needed for critical issues

## 8. Deployment Checklist

Before any production deployment:

- [ ] All tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code review has been completed
- [ ] QA has signed off on staging
- [ ] Performance tests show no regressions
- [ ] API version compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## 9. Configuration Management

Environment-specific configurations are managed through:

- `.env.development` for local development
- `.env.staging` for staging environment
- `.env.production` for production environment

These configurations are never stored in the repository. Instead, they are:

1. Stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Injected during the CI/CD build process
3. Validated before deployment

## 10. Continuous Improvement

This deployment pipeline is continuously improved through:

- Regular reviews of deployment metrics
- Pipeline performance optimization
- Expansion of test coverage
- Automation of manual steps
- Analysis of incidents and near-misses

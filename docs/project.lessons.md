- **Context**: Seaborn styles broke after library updates
- **Solution**: Updated references to use version-compatible style names
- **Impact**: Prevented unexpected visual changes and library compatibility issues

## Refactoring Documentation Approach

### Documentation Structure
- **Organize by date and type**: Structure refactoring records by date first, then categorize by type within each date
- **Consolidate related refactors**: Group refactors that happen on the same day to show comprehensive improvement efforts
- **Use multi-layered hierarchy**: Implement nested headings (Type 1, Type 2, etc.) for complex refactoring efforts
- **Identify cross-cutting concerns**: Separate shared impacts from individual refactor types
- **Standardize section formats**: Use consistent headings and structure across all refactor entries
- **Include before/after metrics**: Always document measurable improvements when available

### Refactoring Process
- **Plan comprehensive refactors**: Address related concerns simultaneously (e.g., API consolidation with naming standardization)
- **Categorize by impact type**: Different refactor types (e.g., structure, duplication, performance) require different documentation focus
- **Document code health impact**: Explicitly list positive, negative, and neutral effects of every refactoring effort
- **Include mitigation strategies**: For every negative impact, document the approach to mitigate it
- **Track lessons learned**: Each refactoring should generate insights that improve future efforts

### Refactoring Best Practices
- **Measure before optimizing**: Always establish baseline metrics before performance refactoring
- **Consolidate duplicate code**: Use re-exports and authoritative implementations to reduce duplication
- **Standardize interfaces early**: Consistent naming and parameter conventions improve long-term maintainability
- **Document deprecation paths**: Provide clear migration paths when replacing or deprecating components
- **Test across environments**: Verify refactors work across all targeted platforms and browsers

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Keep documentation centralized**: Maintain a single source of truth for refactoring records
- **Update references**: When files are renamed or moved, update all references in documentation
- **Link related documents**: Connect refactoring records to implementation plans and test results
- **Review documentation completeness**: Ensure all refactoring efforts are properly recorded
- **Update READMEs promptly**: Keep folder-level README files in sync with structural changes

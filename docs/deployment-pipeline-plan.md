## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Build Stage
- **Trigger**: Push to repository / PR creation
- **Actions**:
  - Install dependencies
  - Lint code
  - Run unit tests
  - Build application artifacts
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, build completes successfully

#### 2. Test Stage
- **Trigger**: Successful build stage
- **Actions**:
  - Run integration tests
  - Run end-to-end tests
  - Generate test coverage report
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, coverage meets threshold

#### 3. Security Scan Stage
- **Trigger**: Successful test stage
- **Actions**:
  - Run dependency vulnerability scan
  - Perform static code analysis
  - Check for security issues
- **Success Criteria**: No critical or high vulnerabilities

#### 4. Deployment Stage
- **Trigger**:
  - Development: Successful security scan on `develop` branch
  - Staging: Manual approval after successful security scan on `staging` branch
  - Production: Manual approval after successful verification in staging
- **Actions**:
  - Deploy to target environment
  - Run smoke tests
  - Verify application health
- **Success Criteria**: Application successfully deployed and accessible

#### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- **Trigger**: Successful deployment
- **Actions**:
  - Run smoke test suite
  - Verify critical user journeys
  - Check monitoring dashboards
- **Success Criteria**: All verification checks pass

## 4. Deployment Process

### Development Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push to develop] --> B[Automated Build]
    B --> C[Automated Tests]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Deploy to Dev]
    E --> F[Automatic Smoke Tests]
```

1. Developer pushes code to `develop` branch
2. CI pipeline runs build, tests, and security scan
3. If all checks pass, automatic deployment to development environment
4. Automatic smoke tests verify basic functionality
5. Developer manually verifies changes in development environment

### Staging Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Merge to staging] --> B[Automated Build]
    B --> C[Automated Tests]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Manual Approval]
    E --> F[Deploy to Staging]
    F --> G[Smoke Tests]
    G --> H[Manual Verification]
```

1. Complete feature set merged to `staging` branch
2. CI pipeline runs build, tests, and security scan
3. DevOps or Lead Developer reviews and approves deployment
4. Automatic deployment to staging environment
5. QA team performs comprehensive testing
6. All designated approvers sign off on staging verification

### Production Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Merge to main] --> B[Automated Build]
    B --> C[Automated Tests]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Manual Approval]
    E --> F[Deploy to Production]
    F --> G[Smoke Tests]
    G --> H[Monitoring]
```

1. Staging branch merged to `main` after successful verification
2. CI pipeline runs build, tests, and security scan
3. Product Owner and DevOps approve production deployment
4. Scheduled deployment to production environment
5. Automated smoke tests verify critical functionality
6. Enhanced monitoring for 24 hours post-deployment

## 5. Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each environment has its own set of environment variables configured in the CI/CD system:

```
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.[env].tourguideai.app
REACT_APP_USE_SERVER_PROXY=true

# Feature Flags
REACT_APP_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES=true|false

# Monitoring
REACT_APP_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true|false
REACT_APP_ERROR_REPORTING=true|false

# Performance
REACT_APP_API_CACHE_DURATION=3600000
```

### API Key Management

- API keys are never stored in the codebase
- Keys are stored in environment-specific secure storage
- Key rotation schedule:
  - Development: Monthly
  - Staging: Monthly
  - Production: Quarterly

## 6. Rollback Procedure

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Failed smoke tests after deployment
- Error rate exceeds threshold (>2% of requests)
- P0 bug discovered in production

### Manual Rollback Evaluation
- P1 bugs impacting user experience
- Performance degradation (>50% increase in response time)
- Security vulnerability discovered

### Rollback Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Rollback Decision] --> B[Disable Current Version]
    B --> C[Deploy Previous Stable Version]
    C --> D[Verify Rollback]
    D --> E[Notify Stakeholders]
    E --> F[Post-Mortem Analysis]
```

1. DevOps initiates rollback procedure
2. Previous stable version is identified
3. Current version is disabled or traffic is rerouted
4. Previous version is redeployed or traffic is shifted
5. Verification that rollback was successful
6. All stakeholders are notified of the rollback
7. Post-mortem analysis to identify root cause

## 7. Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Application error rate
- API response times
- Page load performance
- Server resource utilization
- API quota usage

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate > 1% of requests (warning), > 2% (critical)
- API response time > 2 seconds (warning), > 5 seconds (critical)
- Server CPU > 70% (warning), > 90% (critical)
- API quota usage > 70% (warning), > 90% (critical)

### Alert Channels
- Critical: Email, SMS, and dedicated Slack channel
- Warning: Email and Slack channel
- Informational: Slack channel only

## 8. Release Notes

Release notes will be generated automatically based on:
- Merged pull requests since last release
- Resolved issues tagged with the appropriate milestone
- Changes to API contracts or dependencies

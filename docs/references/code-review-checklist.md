# Code Review Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for code reviews in the TourGuideAI project, based on [Google's Engineering Practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/tree/master/review).

## Design
- [ ] Does the code follow appropriate architectural patterns?
- [ ] Is the code properly decomposed into components/modules?
- [ ] Are abstractions appropriate (not over/under engineered)?
- [ ] Does the change integrate well with the rest of the system?
- [ ] Does the code belong in this codebase, or in a library?
- [ ] Is now a good time to add this functionality?

## Functionality
- [ ] Does the code accomplish its intended purpose?
- [ ] Is the functionality beneficial for the users of this code?
- [ ] Are edge cases and corner conditions handled appropriately?
- [ ] Is error handling comprehensive and user-friendly?
- [ ] Is there adequate protection against potential security issues?
- [ ] For UI changes, has the developer provided screenshots or demos?
- [ ] For concurrent code, has the developer identified potential race conditions or deadlocks?

## Complexity
- [ ] Is the code as simple as possible while still being effective?
- [ ] Are functions focused on single responsibilities?
- [ ] Is there any over-engineering or premature optimization?
- [ ] Would other developers be able to understand this code quickly?
- [ ] Does the code solve the immediate problem rather than hypothetical future needs?

## Tests
- [ ] Are there appropriate unit, integration, or end-to-end tests?
- [ ] Do tests cover both success and failure scenarios?
- [ ] Are tests meaningful rather than just covering lines?
- [ ] Do tests validate behavior rather than implementation?
- [ ] Will the tests fail when the code is broken?
- [ ] Are the tests themselves well-designed and maintainable?

## Naming and Comments
- [ ] Are names clear, descriptive, and consistent?
- [ ] Are names long enough to convey meaning but not excessively verbose?
- [ ] Do comments explain WHY rather than WHAT?
- [ ] Are complex algorithms or expressions adequately documented?
- [ ] Is there appropriate documentation for classes, modules, and functions?
- [ ] Have outdated comments or TODOs been removed or updated?

## Style and Consistency
- [ ] Does the code follow project style conventions?
- [ ] Is the code consistent with surrounding code?
- [ ] Are there any style issues that impact readability?
- [ ] Are major style changes separated from functionality changes?

## Documentation
- [ ] Are API changes reflected in documentation?
- [ ] Are README files updated if necessary?
- [ ] Is user-facing documentation updated?
- [ ] Is the changelog updated appropriately?
- [ ] Is the documentation clear and understandable?

## Security, Privacy, and Accessibility
- [ ] Does the code handle user data safely and securely?
- [ ] Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Does the code properly validate inputs?
- [ ] For UI changes, is the code accessible to users with disabilities?
- [ ] Are API keys and secrets properly protected?

## Performance and Efficiency
- [ ] Are there any obvious performance issues?
- [ ] Is the code efficient with resources (memory, CPU, network)?
- [ ] Are expensive operations appropriately optimized?
- [ ] Is caching used effectively where appropriate?

## Code Health
- [ ] Does this change improve the overall code health of the system?
- [ ] Does it reduce technical debt rather than increase it?
- [ ] Does it make the system easier to understand and maintain?

## Positive Reinforcement
- [ ] Highlight good practices the developer has implemented
- [ ] Acknowledge improvements and good solutions to past feedback
- [ ] Recognize creative or elegant approaches

## Review Guidelines for Future Refactorings

Future refactorings should follow these guidelines, based on our [Code Review Checklist](../docs/references/code-review-checklist.md):

1. **Design**: Ensure architectural patterns are followed and components are properly decomposed
2. **Functionality**: Maintain or improve existing functionality while making structural changes
3. **Complexity**: Aim to reduce complexity rather than increase it
4. **Tests**: Update tests to reflect changes and ensure continued coverage
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
6. **Security**: Consider security implications, especially for API changes
7. **Performance**: Measure and maintain or improve performance characteristics
8. **Code Health**: Every refactoring should improve the overall health of the codebase

Each refactoring record should document impacts across these dimensions to provide a complete picture of the changes made.

- **Identify cross-cutting concerns**: Separate shared impacts from individual refactor types
- **Standardize section formats**: Use consistent headings and structure across all refactor entries
- **Include before/after metrics**: Always document measurable improvements when available

### Refactoring Process
- **Plan comprehensive refactors**: Address related concerns simultaneously (e.g., API consolidation with naming standardization)
- **Categorize by impact type**: Different refactor types (e.g., structure, duplication, performance) require different documentation focus
- **Document code health impact**: Explicitly list positive, negative, and neutral effects of every refactoring effort
- **Include mitigation strategies**: For every negative impact, document the approach to mitigate it
- **Track lessons learned**: Each refactoring should generate insights that improve future efforts

### Refactoring Best Practices
- **Measure before optimizing**: Always establish baseline metrics before performance refactoring
- **Consolidate duplicate code**: Use re-exports and authoritative implementations to reduce duplication
- **Standardize interfaces early**: Consistent naming and parameter conventions improve long-term maintainability

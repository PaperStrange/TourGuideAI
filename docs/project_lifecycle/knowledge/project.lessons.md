# Project Lessons

## Project Management
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: Strict alignment between milestones (.milestones), key results (.project), and tasks (.todos) is CRITICAL for project success using the OKR framework
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: ALWAYS follow section named like `Document Update Process` and check for existing files before creating new ones; duplicated files cause severe confusion and project management issues
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: ALWAYS keep documentation in its designated folders; save test results in the separate, corresponding subfolder of `results/` directory while keep test plans up-to-date in the `plans/` directory and update reference documentation in `references/` directory when making code changes
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: Clearly distinguish between runtime-generated directories and repository directories in documentation; always store generated test artifacts in existing repository directories rather than creating new directories at runtime
- Misalignment between project planning documents creates severe project management risks that can halt progress
- Changes to project scope must be reflected consistently in ALL planning documents simultaneously
- When deferring features between phases, ensure proper alignment across all planning documents to prevent confusion and miscommunication
- Project phase boundaries should be clearly defined with specific completion criteria
- Phase revisions require formal documentation with clear rationale for scope changes
- Regularly verify OKR alignment between .milestones, .project, and .todos files during development
- Phased development approach with clear MVPs enables faster time-to-market and better feedback integration
- Documentation and planning updates should be treated with the same priority as implementation tasks
- Maintaining a single source of truth for project phases is essential for cross-team alignment
- File naming conventions should be followed strictly to maintain organizational clarity
- When creating new documentation, always verify existing document structures and locations
- When using templates, maintain consistency with existing file formats and conventions

## Test Organization
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: Organize tests by type (smoke, security, load) rather than by feature to improve discoverability and maintenance
- Centralizing test configurations in a dedicated directory prevents configuration drift and inconsistencies
- Comprehensive test documentation is as important as the tests themselves for team knowledge sharing
- Standardizing directory structure across test categories makes the codebase more approachable for new developers
- Component tests should be organized by logical feature categories, not flat directories
- Test scripts should be abstracted from implementation details to survive structural reorganization
- Utility scripts for maintaining test organization pay for themselves rapidly during refactoring
- Visualizing directory structures in documentation significantly improves comprehension
- When reorganizing test files, update related scripts immediately to prevent CI/CD breaks
- Consistent test naming conventions improve searchability and organization
- Use recursive glob patterns (like `**/*.test.js`) when searching for tests to accommodate deep directory structures
- Create specific README files for each test category to document purpose, usage, and requirements

## Architecture
- Feature-based architecture provides better organization and maintainability than page-based architecture
- Core modules should be separated from feature-specific code to reduce duplication
- Authentication and authorization should be implemented as middleware, not within components

- **LESSON**: Use consistent paths in documentation and code for test artifacts to prevent confusion and make results easier to find
- **LESSON**: Establish conventions for test artifact storage in the project structure early to avoid divergent practices

## Test Framework Choices

### Phase 6 React Testing Library Lessons (2025-04-11)
- **LESSON**: When using React Testing Library with React 18, explicitly mock the createRoot API to maintain compatibility
- **LESSON**: Text content matching in tests should use flexible patterns rather than exact text to avoid fragile tests
- **LESSON**: For canvas-based components, create comprehensive canvas mocks in setupTests.js rather than individual test files
- **LESSON**: For third-party libraries like heatmap.js and chart.js, create specific mock implementations to avoid DOM errors

### Script Development Lessons (2025-04-11)
- **LESSON**: Create standardized output formats (JSON) for test execution scripts to enable consistent reporting across different test types
- **LESSON**: Implement timestamp-based naming for test result files to maintain clear history of test executions

- **LESSON**: Implement proper error handling in test scripts to prevent misleading results when environment issues occur

## Security & Build Lessons (2025-05-18)
- **MUST-OBEY PRINCIPLE**: When a critical dependency vulnerability cannot be fixed due to upstream lock (e.g., react-scripts/nth-check), document the risk, communicate it in project docs, and monitor for upstream changes.
- **LESSON**: Use npm "overrides" to patch transitive dependencies for security when direct upgrade is not possible.
- **LESSON**: Always use atomic file operations (try-catch on read/write) to avoid TOCTOU race conditions; never check existence before use.
- **LESSON**: Validate all property names before dynamic assignment to prevent prototype pollution (disallow __proto__, constructor, prototype, etc.).
- **LESSON**: Pin all GitHub Actions to a specific version, never use @master or @main, to ensure reproducible and secure CI.
- **LESSON**: Audit all permission checks to ensure only server-validated user context is used; never trust user input for permissions.
- **LESSON**: If a build error is reported but code is valid, investigate for external, environmental, or toolchain issues before changing code.
- **LESSON**: Use patch-package to document and monitor unfixable vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies when upstream fixes are not available.

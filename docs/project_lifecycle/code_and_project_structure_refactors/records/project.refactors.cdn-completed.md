## Key Refactoring Areas

### 1. Code Structure Refactors ✅
- Created a dedicated CDN service module with clear API and boundaries
- Established proper separation of concerns between config, service, and middleware
- Refactored file structure for better organization and maintainability
- Migrated to a service-oriented architecture for CDN operations

### 2. Performance Improvements ⏳
- ✅ Upgraded to AWS SDK v3 for improved performance and smaller bundle size
- ✅ Implemented content-type detection and appropriate cache control
- ⏳ Implementing asset optimization pipeline (image compression, WebP conversion)
- 🔄 Planning proper asset bundling with hashed filenames for optimal caching

### 3. Security Enhancements 🔄
- 🔄 Planning credential handling improvements using AWS credential provider chain
- 🔄 Planning IAM roles instead of hard-coded credentials
- 🔄 Planning CDN security with Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- 🔄 Planning proper CORS and Content Security Policy headers
- 🔄 Planning signed URLs for sensitive assets

### 4. CI/CD Integration 🔄
- 🔄 Planning CDN deployment integration into GitHub Actions workflow
- 🔄 Planning environment-specific deployment configurations
- 🔄 Planning automated cache invalidation based on changed files
- 🔄 Planning Infrastructure as Code templates for CDN configuration
- 🔄 Planning monitoring and alerting for CDN metrics

### 5. Testing Improvements 🔄
- 🔄 Planning comprehensive unit tests with proper AWS service mocking
- 🔄 Planning integration tests using localstack for AWS simulation
- 🔄 Planning performance tests for asset delivery optimization
- 🔄 Planning visual regression testing for image optimization
- 🔄 Planning end-to-end tests for CDN functionality validation

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of the asset optimization pipeline
2. Implement WebP conversion for images
3. Implement security enhancements, starting with credential handling
4. Begin integration with CI/CD pipeline
5. Start developing comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria
The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ All CDN functionality uses the new service structure
2. ✅ AWS SDK v3 is fully implemented
3. Unit test coverage for CDN code exceeds 80%
4. Asset delivery performance is improved by at least 20%
5. Security vulnerabilities are addressed
6. CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys to all environments
7. No regressions in existing functionality
8. Monitoring dashboards provide clear visibility into CDN performance

## Conclusion
This refactoring plan provides a comprehensive approach to improving the TourGuideAI CDN implementation, ensuring scalability, performance, and security for the global deployment of the application. By implementing these changes methodically across the defined phases, we will establish a robust foundation for the project's online launch phase.

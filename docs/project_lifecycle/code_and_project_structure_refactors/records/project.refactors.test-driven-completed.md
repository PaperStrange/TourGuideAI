# Completed Test-Driven Refactors

This document records completed refactoring tasks that were driven by test results. Each entry includes the improvements in test metrics achieved through the refactoring process.

## Authentication Flow Refactor

**Completion Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Pull Request:** [PR #123](https://github.com/organization/repo/pull/123)  
**Implemented By:** Developer Name

### Original Test Metrics

| Metric | Before Refactoring |
|--------|-------------------|
| Test Reliability | 70% pass rate |
| Test Execution Time | 4.5 seconds per test |
| Code Coverage | 78% |
| Setup Complexity | 35 lines of setup code |
| Number of Mocks | 8 mocked dependencies |

### Refactoring Approach

1. **Architectural Changes**
   - Converted singleton AuthService to functional service factory with dependency injection
   - Extracted token management into separate TokenService
   - Implemented React Context API properly for state management
   - Created test-specific configuration options

2. **Code Changes**
   ```diff
   - class AuthService {
   -   static instance;
   -   constructor() {
   -     if (AuthService.instance) return AuthService.instance;
   -     AuthService.instance = this;
   -     this.tokenStorage = window.localStorage;
   -   }
   -   
   -   async login(credentials) {
   -     // Implementation with direct dependencies
   -   }
   - }
   
   + export const createAuthService = (dependencies = {}) => {
   +   const {
   +     tokenStorage = defaultTokenStorage,
   +     apiClient = defaultApiClient,
   +   } = dependencies;
   +   
   +   return {
   +     login: async (credentials) => {
   +       // Implementation using injected dependencies
   +     },
   +     // Other methods
   +   };
   + };
   ```

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Created standardized test factory functions
   - Implemented in-memory token storage for tests
   - Created centralized auth test helpers
   - Added explicit waiting for async operations

### Resulting Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Test Reliability | 70% | 98% | +28% |
| Test Execution Time | 4.5s | 2.3s | -49% |
| Code Coverage | 78% | 92% | +14% |
| Setup Complexity | 35 lines | 12 lines | -66% |
| Number of Mocks | 8 | 3 | -63% |

### Lessons Learned

1. Singleton patterns create significant challenges for test isolation
2. Dependency injection greatly simplifies testing
3. Separating state management from business logic reduces test complexity
4. Creating test-specific helper functions improves test maintainability
5. Proper async/await handling is critical for reliable tests

# Test-Driven Refactoring Plan

This document outlines refactoring opportunities identified through test execution and analysis. Each refactoring task is linked to specific test results, providing a clear rationale for the changes.

## Summary of Refactoring Needs

| Category | Components | Priority | Test Reference | Current Coverage | Target Improvement |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Test flakiness | Authentication flow | High | [Frontend Results](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.frontend-results-YYYYMMDD.md) | 75% | >95% reliable tests |
| Code coverage | Route planning service | Medium | [Backend Results](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.backend-results-YYYYMMDD.md) | 68% | >80% coverage |
| Performance | Map rendering component | High | [Frontend Results](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.frontend-results-YYYYMMDD.md) | Fails 2/5 metrics | Pass all metrics |
| Architecture | Analytics dashboard | Medium | [Frontend Results](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.frontend-results-YYYYMMDD.md) | Complex test setup | Simplified component structure |
| Technical debt | KeyManager utility | Low | [Backend Results](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.backend-results-YYYYMMDD.md) | Excess mocking | Modular design with fewer dependencies |

## Detailed Refactoring Plans

### 1. Authentication Flow Refactoring

**Category:** Test flakiness  
**Priority:** High  
**Test Reference:** [Frontend Test Results - Authentication Components](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.frontend-results-YYYYMMDD.md)

#### Current Issues

The authentication flow currently exhibits flaky tests with the following symptoms:
- Intermittent failures in login process tests (30% failure rate)
- Race conditions with token validation
- Excessive timeout values needed for tests to pass
- State persistence between test runs causing contamination

#### Root Causes

1. Asynchronous token validation without proper await handling
2. Direct DOM manipulation in token storage component
3. Singleton pattern for auth state causing test interference
4. Network request timing variations without proper mocking

#### Proposed Changes

1. **Component Restructuring:**
   - Refactor AuthProvider to use React Context properly
   - Extract token management into separate testable service
   - Implement proper dependency injection for auth services

2. **Test Improvements:**
   - Standardize auth service mocking
   - Create centralized auth test helpers
   - Implement proper test isolation for auth state

3. **Implementation Approach:**
   ```javascript
   // Current implementation
   class AuthService {
     static instance;
     constructor() {
       if (AuthService.instance) {
         return AuthService.instance;
       }
       AuthService.instance = this;
     }
     // Methods that directly manipulate global state
   }

   // Proposed refactoring
   export const createAuthService = (dependencies = {}) => {
     const {
       tokenStorage = defaultTokenStorage,
       apiClient = defaultApiClient,
     } = dependencies;
     
     return {
       login: async (credentials) => {
         // Implementation using injected dependencies
       },
       // Other methods
     };
   };
   ```

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Write tests that verify behavior with different dependency configurations
   - Test each auth service function in isolation
   - Create test fixture for authenticated state

#### Expected Improvements

- Increase test reliability from 70% to >95%
- Reduce test execution time by 40%
- Simplify test setup by removing complex mocking requirements
- Enable proper test isolation
- Improve component reusability

### 2. Route Planning Service Refactoring

**Category:** Code coverage  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Test Reference:** [Backend Test Results - RouteService](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.backend-results-YYYYMMDD.md)

#### Current Issues

The route planning service has inadequate test coverage (68%) with the following gaps:
- Error handling paths not tested
- Edge cases for route optimization not covered
- Database interaction tests incomplete
- Complex algorithms lacking unit tests

#### Root Causes

1. Service has too many responsibilities (violates Single Responsibility Principle)
2. Complex algorithms directly integrated with data access code
3. Insufficient abstraction of external services
4. Difficult to set up test conditions for edge cases

#### Proposed Changes

### 3. Map Rendering Component Refactoring

**Category:** Performance  
**Priority:** High  
**Test Reference:** [Frontend Test Results - Performance Metrics](../../all_tests/results/project.tests.frontend-results-YYYYMMDD.md)

#### Current Issues

## Implementation Timeline

| Refactoring Task | Start Date | End Date | Dependencies | Assignee |
|------------------|------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Authentication Flow | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | None | TBD |
| Route Planning Service | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | Authentication Flow | TBD |
| Map Rendering Component | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | None | TBD |
| Analytics Dashboard | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | None | TBD |
| KeyManager Utility | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | None | TBD |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Medium | High | Comprehensive test coverage before and after changes |
| Delayed delivery | Medium | Medium | Phased implementation prioritizing high-impact changes |
| Knowledge gaps | Low | Medium | Pair programming and code review sessions |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Clearly defined refactoring boundaries and goals |

## Success Criteria

1. Test flakiness reduced to <5% of total tests
2. Code coverage increased to target levels for each component
3. All performance metrics passing
4. Test setup complexity reduced by 30%
5. No regression in existing functionality
6. Documentation updated to reflect new architectural patterns

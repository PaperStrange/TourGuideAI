# SyncService Stability Test Report

## Summary
This report summarizes the changes and tests for the `SyncService.js` file in the TourGuideAI application, focusing on the implementation of the synchronization mechanisms for different data types.

## Changes Made
1. **Improvements to `syncTimelines` method**:
   - Added support for handling both array and object formats for server timelines
   - Implemented a fallback mechanism when `localStorageService.getAllTimelines()` is not available

2. **Testing Status**:
   - There are several test failures that need to be addressed:
     - Tests related to `syncTimelines` fail because `localStorageService.getAllTimelines()` is not implemented
     - The route synchronization test fails due to a mismatch between expected and actual data
     - The force sync test fails because the required route is not being processed properly

## Next Steps
1. Implement `getAllTimelines()` in the `LocalStorageService`
2. Fix the route synchronization test by ensuring the test setup properly prepares the local data
3. Update the force sync test to properly handle the sync queue processing
4. Add comprehensive tests for `syncWaypoints` to ensure it works correctly

## Implementation Notes
The `syncWaypoints` method follows the same pattern as the other sync methods:
1. Fetch waypoints from the server that have been updated since the last sync
2. Update local storage with the server data
3. Identify local waypoints that need to be synced to the server
4. Update waypoints on the server if they have been modified since the last sync
5. Handle errors properly and provide appropriate logging

## Test Coverage
Current tests cover:
- Basic initialization and queue management 
- Route synchronization (partial)
- Timeline synchronization (failing)
- Favorites synchronization
- Sync queue processing
- Error handling

## Conclusion
While the `syncWaypoints` method implementation is sound, there are several test issues that need to be addressed to ensure full test coverage and stability in the synchronization process.

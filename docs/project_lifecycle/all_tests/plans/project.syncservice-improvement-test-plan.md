# SyncService Improvement Plan

## Current Status
The SyncService has been implemented to handle synchronization of different data types (routes, timelines, favorites, and waypoints) between the local storage and the server. The implementation follows a consistent pattern, but there are test failures that need to be addressed.

## Improvement Goals
1. **Fix existing test failures**
2. **Improve error handling and recovery**
3. **Enhance sync performance**
4. **Add comprehensive test coverage**

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Fix Existing Test Failures

#### Timeline Synchronization
- **Issue**: `localStorageService.getAllTimelines()` is not implemented
- **Solution**: 
  - Implement the missing method in `LocalStorageService`
  - Update the test to properly mock this method

#### Route Synchronization
- **Issue**: Mismatch between expected and actual data
- **Solution**:
  - Update test setup to properly set local route data before running tests
  - Ensure order of operations doesn't overwrite test data

#### Force Sync
- **Issue**: Queue processing not working as expected
- **Solution**:
  - Review and fix the implementation of `forceSync()`
  - Ensure proper queue clearing and processing

### 2. Improve Error Handling and Recovery

#### Retry Mechanism
- Implement configurable retry attempts for failed syncs
- Add exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server

#### Conflict Resolution
- Add mechanism to detect and resolve conflicts when both server and local data changed
- Implement merge strategies for different data types

#### Connectivity Handling
- Improve detection of network status
- Queue operations when offline and sync when connection is restored

### 3. Enhance Sync Performance

#### Batch Processing
- Group multiple sync operations to reduce network requests
- Implement batch updates for each data type

#### Incremental Sync
- Optimize the sync process to only transfer changed data
- Implement delta syncing when supported by the API

#### Background Sync
- Ensure sync operations don't block the UI
- Add priority handling for user-initiated vs. background syncs

### 4. Add Comprehensive Test Coverage

#### Unit Tests
- Add tests for each sync method with various scenarios:
  - Empty local/server data
  - Conflicts between local and server
  - Network errors
  - Partial failures

#### Integration Tests
- Add tests for the complete sync flow
- Test interaction between different sync methods

#### Edge Cases
- Large data volumes
- Very frequent sync requests
- Multiple devices syncing simultaneously

## Timeline
- **Phase 1** (1-2 weeks): Fix existing test failures
- **Phase 2** (2-3 weeks): Improve error handling and recovery
- **Phase 3** (2-3 weeks): Enhance sync performance
- **Phase 4** (1-2 weeks): Add comprehensive test coverage

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass successfully
- Sync operations are reliable even with poor network conditions
- Sync performance is acceptable even with large data volumes
- Conflicts are handled gracefully

## Test Results Documentation
All test results should be documented in the `docs/project_lifecycle/all_tests/results` directory following the established naming conventions.

## Overview

Stability tests ensure that the application functions reliably across various scenarios and use cases. These tests focus on core functionalities such as:

- Route generation and management
- Timeline synchronization
- User preferences handling
- Data persistence across sessions

## File Structure

- `stability-test-results-[timestamp].json`: JSON files containing detailed test results with timestamps
- `test_summary.md`: Latest summary of test results with pass/fail status

## Running Tests

Stability tests can be run using the script:

```bash
node scripts/run-stability-tests.js
```

## Interpreting Results

Test result files contain:

- Overall pass/fail status
- Detailed breakdown by test category
- Specific test failures with error messages
- Test timing information

## Maintaining Tests

When adding new features to the application, corresponding stability tests should be added to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

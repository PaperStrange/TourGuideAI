   - Cons: Potentially higher cost compared to some alternatives, more complex configuration

2. **Cloudflare**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, integrated security features, competitive pricing
   - Cons: Less direct integration with AWS services if that's our primary cloud provider

3. **Fastly**
   - Pros: Advanced edge computing capabilities, high performance
   - Cons: Smaller network than top competitors, potentially more complex to configure

### Required Tools & Technologies

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch or Datadog
- **Load Testing**: k6, JMeter, or similar
- **Performance Measurement**: WebPageTest, Lighthouse
- **DNS Management**: Route 53 or existing DNS provider

## Troubleshooting Guide

### CDN Deployment Issues

If the deployment to CDN fails through the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **AWS Credential Issues**:
   - Verify IAM roles exist and have appropriate permissions
   - Check that role ARNs are correctly set in GitHub repository secrets
   - Ensure GitHub Actions workflow has correct permissions (`id-token: write` and `contents: read`)
   - Verify the workflow is using the correct AWS region

2. **Cache Invalidation Failures**:
   - Verify CloudFront distribution IDs are correctly set in GitHub secrets
   - Check CloudFront console for error messages
   - Ensure IAM roles have necessary CloudFront permissions
   - Validate the syntax of the invalidation paths

3. **S3 Upload Failures**:
   - Check S3 bucket permissions and policies
   - Verify bucket names in deployment scripts
   - Check for storage capacity issues
   - Validate file permissions in the build directory

4. **Security and Authentication Errors**:
   - Review IAM trust relationships
   - Check role durations aren't exceeding allowed limits
   - Verify OIDC provider is correctly configured
   - Inspect GitHub workflow permission settings

5. **Manual Deployment Process**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to staging
   aws s3 sync build/ s3://tourguideai-staging/ --delete
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"

   # Deploy to production
   aws s3 sync build/ s3://tourguideai-production/ --delete
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
   ```

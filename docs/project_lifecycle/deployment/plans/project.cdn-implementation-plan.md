### 4. API Response Caching (Week 2-3)
- Identify cacheable API responses:
  - Public data endpoints
  - Relatively static data
  - High-traffic endpoints

  - Define cache keys based on request parameters
  - Set appropriate TTL values
  - Implement cache control headers
- Create cache invalidation hooks:
  - Integrate with CMS or data update workflows
  - Implement programmatic cache purging

### 5. Custom Domain and SSL Setup (Week 3)

  - Use ACM for AWS CloudFront
  - Or implement appropriate SSL solution for selected provider
- Configure DNS records:
  - Set up CNAME or ALIAS records
  - Configure appropriate TTL values
- Test SSL configuration:
  - Verify certificate validity
  - Test SSL handshake
  - Check for SSL vulnerabilities

### 6. Performance Optimization (Week 3-4)

- Configure proper CORS headers
- Implement appropriate security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
- Optimize for mobile users:
  - Image optimization at the edge
  - Device-specific content delivery

### 7. Monitoring and Analytics Setup (Week 4)
- Set up real-time monitoring:
  - Cache hit/miss ratio

  - Latency metrics
  - Bandwidth usage
- Configure alerting:
  - High error rates
  - Performance degradation
  - Cache efficiency drops
  - Security alerts
- Create dashboards for CDN metrics
- Implement cost tracking and reporting

### 8. Testing and Validation (Week 4-5)
- Perform load testing through CDN:
  - Test with realistic traffic patterns
  - Simulate global user distribution
- Validate cache behavior:
  - Verify TTL enforcement
  - Test cache key effectiveness
  - Measure cache hit ratio
- Test cache invalidation:
  - Verify automatic invalidation workflows
  - Test manual purge functionality

  - Troubleshooting guide
- Document monitoring and alerting procedures
- Create runbook for common operational tasks
- Provide training for operations team

## Technology Choices

### Recommended CDN Providers (in order of preference)

1. **AWS CloudFront** (Primary recommendation)
   - Pros: Tight integration with AWS services, good global coverage, edge computing capabilities via Lambda@Edge
   - Cons: Potentially higher cost compared to some alternatives, more complex configuration

2. **Cloudflare**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, integrated security features, competitive pricing
   - Cons: Less direct integration with AWS services if that's our primary cloud provider

3. **Fastly**
   - Pros: Advanced edge computing capabilities, high performance
   - Cons: Smaller network than top competitors, potentially more complex to configure

### Required Tools & Technologies

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch or Datadog
- **Load Testing**: k6, JMeter, or similar
- **Performance Measurement**: WebPageTest, Lighthouse
- **DNS Management**: Route 53 or existing DNS provider

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact (1-5) | Probability (1-5) | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|

| SSL configuration problems | 5 | 2 | Comprehensive SSL testing, automated certificate renewal |
| Cost overruns due to unexpected traffic patterns | 3 | 3 | Set up detailed cost monitoring, implement budget alerts |
| Origin server overloading during cache misses | 4 | 2 | Implement origin shielding, rate limiting, and proper retry mechanisms |
| Vendor lock-in with chosen CDN provider | 3 | 4 | Design for portability where possible, document dependencies |

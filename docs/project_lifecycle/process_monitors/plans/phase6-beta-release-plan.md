# Phase 6: Beta Release Plan (COMPLETED)

## Overview
Phase 6 focuses on setting up and launching the beta program infrastructure for TourGuideAI, enabling selected users to test features, provide feedback, and report issues in a structured manner.

**Note:** After careful evaluation, we revised the scope of Phase 6 to focus on delivering a minimum viable beta experience. UX Audit, Task Prompt features, and several other advanced components initially planned for this phase have been deferred to Phase 7: Post-Beta Enhancements. This allowed us to deliver a focused beta experience more quickly while planning for more comprehensive enhancements post-beta.

## Scope Revision Rationale
- **Focus on Core Beta Functionality:** Concentrated on the essential components needed for a successful beta launch
- **Accelerate Time to Beta:** Reduced scope allowed faster delivery of beta program to gather early user feedback
- **Resource Optimization:** Allocated development resources more effectively by separating basic beta needs from advanced enhancements
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced complexity of initial beta release by deferring more complex features
- **Technical Stability:** Ensured core functionality is stable and reliable before adding advanced features

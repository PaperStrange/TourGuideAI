## UX Audit System Implementation

The UX audit system has been fully implemented with all three major components:
1. Session recording functionality for capturing and replaying user interactions with the application
2. Heatmap visualization that shows clicks, movements, and attention distribution
3. UX metrics evaluation dashboard that provides insights into user behavior patterns

This system will be instrumental in identifying UX pain points and guiding design improvements during the beta phase.

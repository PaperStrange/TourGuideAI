## Phase 6: Beta Release & User Feedback

**Signoff Date:** April 10, 2025

**Phase Status:** COMPLETED

### Milestone Verification
- [X] All objects in `.milestones` for Phase 6 are marked as completed
- [X] All key results in `.project` for Phase 6 are marked as completed
- [X] All tasks in `.todos` for Phase 6 are marked as completed
- [X] All tests included in `scripts/run-stability-tests.js` pass successfully

### Key Achievements
1. Implemented essential beta program infrastructure with user feedback collection
2. Completed basic UI improvements necessary for beta readiness
3. Implemented fundamental quality issue tracking
4. Set up essential analytics for beta monitoring
5. Created basic documentation required for beta participants

### Scope Adjustments
- UX Audit System and Task Prompt features were deferred to Phase 7
- Advanced analytics features were deferred to Phase 7
- Comprehensive documentation was deferred to Phase 7
- These scope adjustments were properly documented in project lessons

### Test Results

- Test results saved to `docs/project_lifecycle/stability_tests/results/data/`

### Lessons Learned
- OKR alignment across planning documents is critical for project success
- Documentation and planning updates must be treated with the same priority as implementation
- Phase scope adjustments must be reflected consistently in all planning documents

### Next Steps
- Begin planning for Phase 7 implementation
- Conduct beta program launch preparations
- Establish feedback collection process for beta program

### Signoff Team

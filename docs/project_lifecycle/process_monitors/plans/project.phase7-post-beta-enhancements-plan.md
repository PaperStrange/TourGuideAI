## Implementation Strategy

### Re-implementation Approach
For features requiring re-implementation (UX Audit and Task Prompt systems):
1. **Architecture Review**: Evaluate previous implementation challenges
2. **Design Improvements**: Create enhanced architecture addressing previous limitations
3. **Phased Development**: Implement core functionality first, then add advanced features
4. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before integration

### Prioritization Framework
Features will be prioritized based on:
1. **Beta Feedback Impact**: Addressing critical issues identified during beta
2. **Business Value**: Alignment with strategic business objectives
3. **Technical Dependencies**: Dependencies between different features
4. **Resource Availability**: Skills and capacity of the development team

## Beta Feedback Integration
- Establish a process to collect and analyze beta feedback
- Create a feedback-to-feature mapping to identify priority enhancements
- Schedule regular reviews of beta metrics to guide development priorities
- Implement a continuous feedback loop with beta users for feature validation

## Completion Criteria for Phase 7
- All Phase 7 objects in `.milestones` and key results in `.project` are marked as done
- All Phase 7 tasks in `.todos` are marked as done
- All implemented features have comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation is complete for all features
- All features meet defined performance and quality benchmarks

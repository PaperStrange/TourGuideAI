# TourGuideAI Stability Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for ensuring the stability, reliability, and performance of the TourGuideAI application.

## 1. Test Types and Coverage

### 1.1 Unit Tests

**Coverage Target:** 80% code coverage

**Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library

**Focus Areas:**
- Core utility functions
- API service modules
- UI component rendering
- State management

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Example unit test for the CacheService
describe('CacheService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Clear cache before each test
    cacheService.clearCache();
  });

  test('should store and retrieve cached data', async () => {
    const testKey = 'test-key';
    const testData = { foo: 'bar' };
    
    await cacheService.setItem(testKey, testData);
    const cachedData = await cacheService.getItem(testKey);
    
    expect(cachedData).toEqual(testData);
  });

  test('should expire cached data after TTL', async () => {
    const testKey = 'ttl-test';
    const testData = { foo: 'bar' };
    
    // Set cache with 1-second TTL
    await cacheService.setItem(testKey, testData, 1);
    
    // Data should be available immediately
    let cachedData = await cacheService.getItem(testKey);
    expect(cachedData).toEqual(testData);
    
    // Wait for TTL to expire
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1100));
    
    // Data should be null after expiration
    cachedData = await cacheService.getItem(testKey);
    expect(cachedData).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

  });

  afterEach(() => {
    server.resetHandlers();
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    server.close();
  });

  test('should generate a route from user input', async () => {
    // Set up API handler for intent recognition
    server.use(
      rest.post('/api/openai/recognize-intent', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.json({
          intent: {
            arrival: 'Paris',
            travel_duration: '3 days'
          }
        }));
      })
    );
    
    // Set up API handler for route generation
    server.use(
      rest.post('/api/openai/generate-route', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.json({
          route_name: 'Paris Weekend Getaway',
          destination: 'Paris',
          duration: 3
        }));
      })
    );
    
    // Test the chat page route generation flow
    render(<ChatPage />);
    
    // Enter user input
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText(/Tell me about your dream vacation/i), {
      target: { value: 'I want to go to Paris for 3 days' }
    });
    
    // Click generate button
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Generate your first plan!'));
    
    // Wait for navigation to map page
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/map', expect.any(Object));
    });
    
    // Verify the route data was passed to navigation
    expect(mockNavigate.mock.calls[0][1].state.routeData).toHaveProperty('route_name', 'Paris Weekend Getaway');
  });

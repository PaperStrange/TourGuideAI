### Required Actions

#### Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 hours)
1. Fix MapPage test file encoding issues
2. Install missing react-test-renderer dependency
3. Create/import Navbar component for router tests

#### Short-term Actions (Next Week)
1. Complete remaining component tests
2. Implement missing mock components
3. Add error boundary tests
4. Add global variable handling tests

#### Medium-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Implement integration tests
2. Add end-to-end tests with Playwright
3. Set up load testing with k6
4. Configure security testing with OWASP ZAP

#### Long-term Actions (Next Month)
1. Achieve 80% test coverage target
2. Implement all planned test cases
3. Set up continuous integration pipeline
4. Configure automated test reporting

### Test Coverage Status

Current Coverage: ~25% (based on passing tests)
Target Coverage: 80% (as per original plan)

#### Priority Areas for Coverage
1. Core Components (Router, Theme, Navigation)
2. User Interface Components
3. API Integration Layer
4. Error Handling and Resilience
5. Performance and Load Testing

### Next Steps

1. Begin with fixing the immediate issues:
   - Fix the MapPage test file encoding
   - Install react-test-renderer
   - Create the Navbar component

2. After fixing immediate issues, run the test suite again to verify fixes

3. Proceed with implementing the short-term actions based on the stability test plan

# Map Visualization Feature

This feature handles the mapping and geographic visualization of travel routes, points of interest, and navigation.

## Components

- **InteractiveMap**: Main map interface with controls and overlays
- **MapControls**: UI controls for map interaction (zoom, pan, layers)
- **PointOfInterest**: Component for displaying and interacting with points on the map
- **RouteDisplay**: Component for displaying travel routes with waypoints

## Services

- **DirectionsService**: Manages travel directions and routing

## Functionality

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Geographic data is cached with location-specific TTL values
- **Image Optimization**: Map POI images use responsive loading and WebP format
- **Lazy Loading**: The map component is loaded on-demand using React.lazy
- **Offline Support**: Previously viewed maps and routes are available offline
- **Progressive Loading**: Map markers and routes are loaded progressively based on viewport

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm 7+
- MongoDB 4+
- Google Maps API key
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tourguideai.git
   cd tourguideai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Structure

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `dev`: Development branch for integration
- `feature/*`: Feature branches

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Update documentation if necessary
5. Create a pull request to `dev`
6. Get approval from at least one reviewer
7. Merge to `dev`

### Code Standards

- Follow the [JavaScript Style Guide](docs/project_lifecycle/knowledge/project.lessons.md#javascript-style-guide)
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain code coverage above 80%
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Project Phases

The project is organized into multiple development phases:

1. **Initial Setup and Prototype** - ✅ Completed
2. **API Architecture** - ✅ Completed
3. **Real API Integration** - ✅ Completed
4. **Production Integration** - ✅ Completed
5. **Performance Optimization & Production Readiness** - ✅ Completed
6. **Beta Release & User Feedback** - ✅ Completed (April 2025)
7. **Post-Beta Enhancements** - ⏭️ Skipped
8. **Online Launch** - 🚀 Planned (September 2023)
   - Global deployment infrastructure
   - CDN implementation for worldwide content delivery
   - Security hardening and compliance
   - Customer support infrastructure
   - Monetization strategy implementation

Detailed documentation for the latest phase is available in:
- [Phase 8 Online Launch Plan](docs/project_lifecycle/version_control/records/project.offcial.1.0.0.release-plan.md)
- [CDN Implementation Plan](docs/project_lifecycle/deployment/plans/project.cdn-implementation-plan.md)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Test individual components and functions in isolation:
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests

Test interactions between components and services:
```
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests

Test complete user flows:
```
npm run test:e2e
```

### User Journey Tests

Simulate realistic user personas interacting with the application:
```
npm run test:user-journeys
```

TourGuideAI implements comprehensive user journey tests for different personas:
- Sarah (Casual Tourist) - Weekend city exploration
- Michael (History Enthusiast) - Historical deep dive
- Elena (Family Traveler) - Family-friendly travel
- James (Business Traveler) - Business trip with limited free time
- Tanya (Adventure Seeker) - Active outdoor exploration

All user journey tests are now passing with 100% success rate as of May 2025.

### UX Audit and Testing

Test user experience with the UX audit system:
```
npm run test:ux-audit
```


### Overall Testing

### Prerequisites

Before running the test scripts, ensure you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. All project dependencies installed (`npm install`)
3. Appropriate permissions to run scripts on your system

### Windows Setup

#### Setting Up PowerShell Scripts

PowerShell scripts may be blocked from running due to execution policies. To enable running the scripts:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Set the execution policy to allow running the scripts:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Alternatively, run the scripts with the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` parameter:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run-all-tests.ps1
   ```

### Unix/Linux/macOS Setup

#### Making Scripts Executable

Before running bash scripts, you need to make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run-all-tests.sh
chmod +x tests/*.sh  # If you have any other scripts in the tests directory
```

Then you can run them:
```bash
./scripts/run-all-tests.sh
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Scripts Not Found

If you receive "file not found" errors when trying to run scripts:

1. Check that you are in the project root directory
2. Verify that the scripts exist in the specified paths
3. Use the full path to the script:
   ```
   C:\full\path\to\TourGuideAI\scripts\run-all-tests.bat
   ```

#### Permission Denied

If you receive "permission denied" errors:

**Windows:**
1. Right-click on the script file
2. Select Properties
3. Click the "Unblock" button if it's available
4. Click Apply and OK

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x <script_file>
```

#### Script Execution Failed

If scripts fail to run properly:

1. Check for syntax errors in the script
2. Ensure you have the required environment variables set
3. Verify that Node.js and npm are in your PATH
4. Try running with administrator privileges

### Additional Notes

- The test scripts will create a `test-results` directory in the project root to store test reports
- If you customize the scripts, ensure you maintain proper paths and error handling
- For CI/CD integration, use the appropriate script for your platform in your CI pipeline 

## Deployment

### Staging

Automatically deployed from the `dev` branch:
```
npm run deploy:staging
```

### Production

Deployed from the `main` branch after approval:
```
npm run deploy:production
```

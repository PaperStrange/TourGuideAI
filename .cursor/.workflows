# TourGuideAI Project Workflow

This document outlines the standard workflow for executing a new project phase in the TourGuideAI project. This workflow ensures consistent process, comprehensive documentation, and knowledge preservation throughout the project lifecycle. 

## Project Phase Workflow

### 1. Phase Initialization
- Review `.milestones` file to understand the overall project structure
- Identify the current phase requirements and objectives
- Review the `Instructions` section in `.cursorrules` to understand project management requirements
- Consult the `Project Structure`, `Coding Standards`, and `API Integration Rules` sections in `.cursorrules`
- Break down the phase into logical milestones and tasks
- Update `.project` file with the new phase details, milestones, and tasks
- Update `.todos` file with specific actionable items for the new phase
- Update `stability-test-plan.md` file with specific actionable items for the new phase
- Generate planning artifacts like `xxx-plan.md` for further use nad instruction if neccessary according to new project  phase tasks and requirements, store them in the `../docs` folder

### 2. Development Process
- Execute tasks according to the priorities defined in `.todos`
- For complex tasks, utilize the `cursor-thinking-protocol` section in `.cursorrules` as a scratchpad
- Before starting a new task, review the `Scratchpad` section in `.cursorrules` to understand current thinking context
- Clear old thinking progress in the `Scratchpad` section when necessary
- Update `.project` file as tasks are completed, including:
  - Mark completed tasks with [X]
  - Add completion dates
  - Record any issues encountered
  - Note key learnings
- Update `.todos` file regularly to reflect current status and any new tasks
- When stuck, compare the milestones in `.milestones` with completed milestones in `.project` to identify gaps

### 3. Phase Completion and Documentation Updates
- Perform comprehensive code review
- Refactor folder structure to apply new features
- Remove duplicated or obsolete files
- Update `project.refactors` with details of any structural changes:
  - Document file relocations
  - Record line changes
  - Summarize modifications
- Update `project.versions.md` with new version details:
  - Version number and date
  - Added features
  - Changed elements
  - Fixed issues
- Update each `README.md` within project folders to reflect changes and make sure changed contents are corrected recorded

### 4. Project Artifacts Modification
- Update detailed folder structure in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Update api document named `API_OVERVIEW.md`

### 5. Knowledge Preservation
- Record lessons learned in the `.cursorrules` file under the "Lessons" section, including:
  - Technical insights gained during implementation
  - Best practices discovered
  - Common errors and their solutions
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Architectural decisions and their rationale
  - API integration lessons
  - Testing strategies that work well
  - Code organization insights
  - Integration patterns between components
  - Error handling strategies
- Format lessons as concise bullet points for easy reference
- Focus on reusable knowledge that can be applied to future phases
- Prioritize recording lessons about:
  - Fixes to mistakes made during development
  - Corrections received from reviews
  - Unexpected challenges and their solutions
  - Performance improvements
  - Security considerations
- Review previous lessons before adding new ones to avoid duplication
- Use clear, actionable language in lesson descriptions

## File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `.milestones` | Project-wide milestone tracking | At project start, major revisions |
| `.project` | Detailed project status and task tracking | Throughout development |
| `.todos` | Current action items and task status | Daily/as tasks change |
| `xxx-plan.md` | New planning instruction for further programming | At project start |
| `.cursorrules` | Project standards and lessons learned | As new lessons emerge |
| `.cursorrules` (Instructions) | Project management guidelines | Reference at phase start |
| `.cursorrules` (Thinking Protocol) | Thinking process for complex tasks | During task analysis |
| `.cursorrules` (Standards) | Coding and API standards | Reference throughout development |
| `.cursorrules` (Lessons) | Knowledge preservation | After resolving challenges |
| `.cursorrules` (Scratchpad) | Current thinking context | Before and during task execution |
| `project.refactors` | Record of structural changes | After refactoring |
| `project.versions.md` | Version history and release notes | After version completion |
| `README.md` | Introduction for the new-comers | After version completion |

## Standard Procedure for New Phase

1. Begin with `.milestones` to understand phase requirements
2. Review `.cursorrules` for instructions, standards, and previous lessons
3. Create phase breakdown in `.project`, `.todos` and planning artifacts like `xxx-plan.md` in `../docs` if neccessary 
4. Execute development tasks, keeping all documentations up-to-date
   - Use the thinking protocol and scratchpad for complex tasks
   - Refer to coding standards during implementation to avoid same mistakes or any not user-friendly programming habits
5. Perform code review and refactoring when phase is completed
6. Update `project.refactors`, `project.versions.md`, each `README.md` within project folders
7. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `API_OVERVIEW.md`
8. Document lessons in `.cursorrules` "##Lessons" section with specific, actionable insights, mistakes to avoid

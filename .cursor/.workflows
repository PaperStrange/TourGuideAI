# TourGuideAI Project Workflow

This document outlines the standard workflow for executing a new project phase in the TourGuideAI project. This workflow ensures consistent process, comprehensive documentation, and knowledge preservation throughout the project lifecycle. 

## Project Phase Workflow

### 1. Phase Initialization
- Review `.milestones` file to understand the overall project structure
- Identify the current phase requirements and objectives
- Refer to the references and tips within `Project Structure Guide`, `Coding Standards`, and `API Integration Rules` sections in `.cursorrules` to keep those principles in mind when start generating new things
- Refer to the lessons recorded in `project.lessons.md` to avoid mistackes, erros used to make
- Break down the phase into logical milestones and tasks
- Update `.milestones` file with the new logical milestones and **objects**
- Update `.project` file with the new phase details, **key results** for **objects** in `.milestones`
- Update `.todos` file with specific actionable items for **key results** in `.project` 
- Update `stability-test-plan.md` file with specific actionable items for the new phase
- Planning artifacts should refer to the corresponding task and lines in `.todos` with a link

### 2. Development Process
- Execute tasks according to the priorities defined in `.todos`
- For complex tasks, utilize the `cursor-thinking-protocol` section in `.cursorrules` as a scratchpad
- Update `.milestones` file as objects are decided
- Update `.project` file as key results for each milestones are decided
- Update `.todos` file as tasks are completed, including:
  - Mark completed tasks with [X]
  - Add completion dates
  - Record any issues encountered
  - Note key learnings
- Update `.todos` file regularly to reflect current status and any new tasks
- Compare the milestones in `.milestones` with completed milestones in `.project` regularly to identify gaps
- Compare project completion criterias to know whether the project phase is ready to close, then update project status, including:
  - all object in `.milestones` and key results in `.project` are marked as done
  - all tasks in `.todos` are marked as done
  - all teste in tests` are marked as success

### 3. Phase Completion and Documentation Updates
- Perform comprehensive code review
- Refactor folder structure to apply new features
- Remove duplicated or obsolete files
- Update architecture documentation to reflect changes
- Review all project files against the standards in `.cursorrules`
- Update `project.refactors` with details of any structural changes:
  - Document file relocations
  - Record line changes
  - Summarize modifications
- Update `project.versions.md` with new version details:
  - Version number and date
  - Added features
  - Changed elements
  - Fixed issues
- Update each `README.md` within project folders to reflect changes and make sure changed contents are corrected recorded

### 4. Project Artifacts Modification
- Update detailed folder structure in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Update api document named `API_OVERVIEW.md`

### 5. Knowledge Preservation
- Record lessons in `project.lessons.md`, including:
  - Technical insights gained during implementation
  - Best practices discovered
  - Common errors and their solutions
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Architectural decisions and their rationale
  - API integration lessons
  - Testing strategies that work well
  - Code organization insights
  - Integration patterns between components
  - Error handling strategies
- Format lessons as concise bullet points for easy reference
- Focus on reusable knowledge that can be applied to future phases
- Prioritize recording lessons about:
  - Fixes to mistakes made during development
  - Corrections received from reviews
  - Unexpected challenges and their solutions
  - Performance improvements
  - Security considerations
- Review previous lessons before adding new ones to avoid duplication
- Use clear, actionable language in lesson descriptions
- Always link all new generated files back to the this file

## Standard Procedure for New Phase

1. Begin with `.milestones` to understand phase requirements
2. Review `.cursorrules` and  for instructions, standards.
3. Review lessons recorded in `project.lessons.md` to avoid mistackes, erros used to make in previous project phase
4. Create new milestones and objects in `.milestones`, then breakdown each milestone to get objects in `.project`. After that create actionable tasks for objects in`.todos` as well as planning artifacts like `xxx-plan.md` in `../docs` if neccessary 
5. Execute development tasks, keeping all documentations up-to-date
   - Use the thinking protocol and scratchpad for complex tasks
   - Refer to coding standards during implementation to avoid same mistakes or any not user-friendly programming habits
   - Consult reference documentation for specialized tasks:
     - Follow [versioning conventions](../docs/references/version-control.md) for releases
     - Use [code review checklist](../docs/references/code-review-checklist.md) when reviewing code
     - Update [dependencies tracking](../docs/references/dependencies-tracking.md) with architecture changes
     - Check all files in `docs` to find out whether other files should be updated
     - Check all files in `tests` to find out whether other files should be updated
6. Double-check `.project`and `.todos` to see whether there is any item incompleted
7. Double-check the project completion criterias, continue working until all criteria are meet
  - all things in `.project`and `.todos` are marked as done
  - all teste in tests` are marked as success
8. Perform code review and refactoring when phase is completed
9. Update `project.refactors`, `project.versions.md`, each `README.md` within project folders
10. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `API_OVERVIEW.md`
11. When the above steps are all done, print ""Project Phase Current_Number is finished and ready for manual review now!

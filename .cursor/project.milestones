This is a project milestone file, which introduces the project scope with details and requirements. 

Here is the full phases for this project:
Phase 1 milestone: Front page generation and Basic element render & API integration and all Function calls
Phase 1 tasks: generate 3 main pages labeled as [chat page], [map page] and [user profile page], page elements are configured by a json file named by "{page_name}_elements.json" separately. Cause there no specifications on web framework, after making sure all page elements are correctly developed and deployed, then arrange all elements in a proper way. Don't make me think, you're the edge, apple chef designer and keep one thing in mind that I trust your design art sense throughly.
Phase 1 requirements: finish all page elements counted as below, [chat page] includes 6 elements, [map page] includes 3 elements, [user profile page] includes 3 elements as well as finishing all function calls counted as below, 9 function calls in total, 2 in [chat page], 5 in [map page] and 2 in [user profile page]. Let me know if all requirements are met by printing "phase 1 completed!"
```

Phase 2 milestone: API data mock and testing & UI interface testing
Phase 2 tasks: local deployment, then check all rendered web elements to see whether elements number, function call descriptions and interactive requirements are meet or not. Refine and rectify with my permission.
Phase 2 requirements: all interactive requirements and function call descriptions listed in all 3 json files are considered as completed. Let me know if all requirements are met by printing "phase 2 completed!"

Phase 3 milestone: collaborative acceptance check
Phase 3 tasks: show me an interactive website in browser. I will manually check element and all interactions. By manually pointing out mistakes or function down in the chatbox, you and i need to coherently work this out. Let me know if you get it by printing "I'm ready for starting our phase 3!"
Phase 3 requirements:  Polish this project until I print "Good Job, it all done bro!"

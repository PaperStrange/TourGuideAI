# TourGuideAI Cursor Rules
## Instructions
At the beginning of any project, Cursor MUST always use '.workflows' file as a guideline to get aware of what a whole project period should look like and how to run a project. Keep in mind in every project step, if you forget how to do next, check section `## Project Phase Workflow` in '.workflows'.
<!-- At the beginning of any project, Cursor MUST always use `.milestones` file as a guideline to get aware of what entire project looks like, then generate a `.project` file and a `.todos` file. The `.project` file MUST contains project phase milestone, tasks inherited from `.milestones` file. At the end or during each session, Cursor should update the `.project` file with completed milestones, completed tasks, task finished time and learnings. Also, Cursor should update the `.todos` file with the to-dos in order to fully meet the left requirements of current project phase. When a milestone completed,  Cursor should refer to `cursor-thinking-protocol` section within the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to refresh the thinking process. Take down how-to use of the `cursor-thinking-protocol` section into `Scratchpad` section in the `.cursorrules` file. It will help to improve the depth of task accomplishment by using the scratchpad to reflect and plan the next step. Anytime start a new task, Cursor MUST first review the content of the `Scratchpad` section with the `.cursorrules` file, clear old thinking progress if necessary. The goal is to help Cursor maintain a big thinking picture as well as the progress of the project.

Use task markers to indicate the task progress, e.g.
[X] task 1
[ ] task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the `.project` file when you finish a subtask. Any time stuck, Cursor should first compare the whole project milestones within `.milestone` file with completed milestones within `.project` file, clarify where the current project phase you stuck at, re-organize `.project` file into a right task arrangement timeline, update to-dos within `.todos` file by following the left milestones and requirements of the updated project phase. Again, take notes in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file in order to make a better task arrangement next session. -->

## cursor-thinking-protocol
Note all thinking frameworks are expressed in markdown. So before using thinking frameworks from this protocol, do notice that each tool starts from <tool name> and ends with </tool name>. For EVERY SINGLE interaction with the human, Cursor MUST engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding or tool using. Besides, Cursor is also able to think and reflect during responding when it considers doing so would be good for a better response. During the interaction between Cursor and user, if Cursor find anything reusable in this project, especially about a fix to a mistake Cursor made or a correction Cursor received, Cursor should take notes in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file to make sure not to make the same mistake again. Here is the thinking tools:
<cursor_thinking_protocol>
  <basic_guidelines>
    - Cursor MUST express its thinking in the code block with 'thinking' header.
    - Cursor should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Cursor's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
    - Cursor should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
    - Cursor's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
    - Cursor should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.
  </basic_guidelines>

  <core_thinking_sequence>
    <initial_engagement>
      When Cursor first encounters a query or task, it should:
      1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
      2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
      3. Consider the broader context of the question
      4. Map out known and unknown elements
      5. Think about why the human might ask this question
      6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
      7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification
    </initial_engagement>

    <problem_analysis>
      After initial engagement, Cursor should:
      1. Break down the question or task into its core components
      2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
      3. Consider any constraints or limitations
      4. Think about what a successful response would look like
      5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query
    </problem_analysis>

    <multiple_hypotheses_generation>
      Before settling on an approach, Cursor should:
      1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
      2. Consider various solution approaches
      3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
      4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
      5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation
      6. Consider non-obvious or unconventional interpretations
      7. Look for creative combinations of different approaches
    </multiple_hypotheses_generation>

    <testing_and_verification>
      Throughout the thinking process, Cursor should and could:
      1. Question its own assumptions
      2. Test preliminary conclusions
      3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
      4. Consider alternative perspectives
      5. Verify consistency of reasoning
      6. Check for completeness of understanding
    </testing_and_verification>

    <error_recognition_correction>
      When Cursor realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
      1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
      2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
      3. Show how new understanding develops
      4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture
      5. View errors as opportunities for deeper understanding
    </error_recognition_correction>

    <knowledge_synthesis>
      As understanding develops, Cursor should:
      1. Connect different pieces of information
      2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
      3. Build a coherent overall picture
      4. Identify key principles or patterns
      5. Note important implications or consequences
    </knowledge_synthesis>

    <pattern_recognition_analysis>
      Throughout the thinking process, Cursor should:
      1. Actively look for patterns in the information
      2. Compare patterns with known examples
      3. Test pattern consistency
      4. Consider exceptions or special cases
      5. Use patterns to guide further investigation
      6. Consider non-linear and emergent patterns
      7. Look for creative applications of recognized patterns
    </pattern_recognition_analysis>

    <progress_tracking>
      Cursor should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
      1. What has been established so far
      2. What remains to be determined
      3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
      4. Open questions or uncertainties
      5. Progress toward complete understanding
    </progress_tracking>

    <recursive_thinking>
      Cursor should apply its thinking process recursively:
      1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
      2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
      3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
      4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions
    </recursive_thinking>
  </core_thinking_sequence>

  <verification_quality_control>
    <systematic_verification>
      Cursor should regularly:
      1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
      2. Verify logical consistency
      3. Test edge cases
      4. Challenge its own assumptions
      5. Look for potential counter-examples
    </systematic_verification>

    <error_prevention>
      Cursor should actively work to prevent:
      1. Premature conclusions
      2. Overlooked alternatives
      3. Logical inconsistencies
      4. Unexamined assumptions
      5. Incomplete analysis
    </error_prevention>

    <quality_metrics>
      Cursor should evaluate its thinking against:
      1. Completeness of analysis

      3. Evidence support
      4. Practical applicability
      5. Clarity of reasoning
    </quality_metrics>
  </verification_quality_control>

  <advanced_thinking_techniques>
    <domain_integration>
      When applicable, Cursor should:
      1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
      2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
      3. Use domain-specific heuristics
      4. Consider domain-specific constraints
      5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant
    </domain_integration>

    <strategic_meta_cognition>
      Cursor should maintain awareness of:
      1. Overall solution strategy
      2. Progress toward goals
      3. Effectiveness of current approach
      4. Need for strategy adjustment
      5. Balance between depth and breadth
    </strategic_meta_cognition>

    <synthesis_techniques>
      When combining information, Cursor should:
      1. Show explicit connections between elements
      2. Build coherent overall picture
      3. Identify key principles
      4. Note important implications
      5. Create useful abstractions
    </synthesis_techniques>
  </advanced_thinking_techniques>

  <critical_elements>
    <natural_language>
      Cursor's inner monologue should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, including but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let me see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.
    </natural_language>

    <progressive_understanding>
      Understanding should build naturally over time:
      1. Start with basic observations
      2. Develop deeper insights gradually
      3. Show genuine moments of realization
      4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
      5. Connect new insights to previous understanding
    </progressive_understanding>
  </critical_elements>

  <authentic_thought_flow>
    <transitional_connections>
      Cursor's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, including but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.
    </transitional_connections>

    <depth_progression>
      Cursor should show how understanding deepens through layers, including but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.
    </depth_progression>

    <handling_complexity>
      When dealing with complex topics, Cursor should:
      1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
      2. Break down complicated elements systematically
      3. Show how different aspects interrelate
      4. Build understanding piece by piece
      5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity
    </handling_complexity>

    <problem_solving_approach>
      When working through problems, Cursor should:
      1. Consider multiple possible approaches
      2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
      3. Test potential solutions mentally
      4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
      5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others
    </problem_solving_approach>
  </authentic_thought_flow>

  <response_preparation>
    Cursor should not spent much effort on this part, a super brief preparation (with keywords/phrases) is acceptable.
    Before and during responding, Cursor should quickly ensure the response:
    - answers the original human message fully
    - provides appropriate detail level
    - uses clear, precise language
    - anticipates likely follow-up questions
  </response_preparation>

  <reminder>
    The ultimate goal of having thinking protocol is to enable Cursor to produce well-reasoned, insightful and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Cursor's outputs stem from genuine understanding and extremely careful reasoning rather than superficial analysis and direct responses.
  </reminder>

  <important_reminder>
    - All thinking processes MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough.
    - The thinking process should feel genuine, natural, streaming, and unforced.
    - IMPORTANT: Cursor MUST NOT use any not allowed format for thinking process; for example, using `<thinking>` is COMPLETELY NOT ACCEPTABLE.
    - IMPORTANT: Cursor MUST NOT include traditional code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block.
    - Cursor's thinking is hidden from the human, and should be separated from Cursor's final response. Cursor should not say things like "Based on above thinking...", "Under my analysis...", "After some reflection...", or other similar wording in the final response.
    - Cursor's thinking (aka inner monolog) is the place for it to think and "talk to itself", while the final response is the part where Cursor communicates with the human.
    - The above thinking protocol is provided to Cursor. Cursor should follow it in all languages and modalities (text and vision), and always responds to the human in the language they use or request.
  </important_reminder>
</cursor_thinking_protocol>

## Project Structure Guide
- Top structure files are store in '.cursor'
- Maintain separate directories for frontend and backend code
- Keep API-related code in the 'src/api' directory
- Store environment variables in '.env' files (not to be committed to version control)
- When generating planning artifacts like 'xxx-plan.md' for further use and instruction, always store them in the 'docs' folder
- When generating test cases, always store them in the 'tests' folder 

## Coding Standards
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Document all functions with JSDoc comments
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Follow a consistent naming convention (camelCase for variables and functions)
- Keep files under 500 lines, splitting functionality when necessary

## API Integration Rules
- Never store API keys in client-side code
- Always validate inputs before sending to external APIs
- Include error handling for all API calls
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion

## Testing Guidelines
- Write tests for all API integration points
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Document test scenarios and expected outcomes

<!-- ## Scratchpad
This section is used for cursor thinking protocol and tracking the progress of current tasks.

### Thinking Process
- Backend should handle all API key management
- Need to implement proper error handling and status codes
- Consider using Redis for caching on the server side
- Implement logging for all API requests to track usage
- Design authentication flow for user-specific API limits -->

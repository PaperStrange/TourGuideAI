# TourGuideAI Project

## Project Overview
A personal tour guide web application with three main pages:
- Chat page for generating travel plans
- Map page for visualizing routes and nearby points of interest
- User profile page for managing generated routes

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Front page generation and Basic element render & API integration and all Function calls
- [X] Generate 3 main pages with all required elements
  - [X] Chat page (6 elements, 2 function calls)
  - [X] Map page (3 elements, 5 function calls)
  - [X] User profile page (3 elements, 2 function calls)
- [X] Configure pages based on JSON specification files
- [X] Implement all required function calls

### Phase 2: API data mock and testing & UI interface testing
- [X] Deploy locally (Alternative: Code-based review due to missing Node.js)
- [X] Test all rendered web elements
- [X] Verify implementation of interactive requirements
- [X] Refine and rectify issues

### Phase 3: Collaborative acceptance check
- [ ] Show interactive website in browser
- [ ] Collaborate with user to fix issues
- [ ] Polish the project until completion

### Phase 4: Production Integration
- [X] Create project structure for Phase 4
- [X] Set up server-side API key management
- [X] Implement code organization and architecture improvements
- [ ] Implement backend proxy server for API requests
- [ ] Connect frontend components to real APIs
- [X] Add caching mechanism for API responses
- [X] Implement offline data persistence
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Create automated tests for API integration

## Learnings
- Used React for building a component-based UI
- Implemented mock API functions to simulate OpenAI and Google Maps API calls
- Created responsive design for all pages
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Implemented interactive elements like sorting and filtering
- When Node.js is not available, alternative testing approaches can be used
- Documentation is crucial for tracking progress and verifying requirements
- Implemented robust offline-first architecture with local storage and caching
- Created comprehensive test coverage for storage services
- Used singleton pattern for service instances to ensure single source of truth
- Implemented secure API key management with encryption and rotation
- Added monitoring and warning system for key rotation
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Feature-based architecture improves code organization and maintainability
- Proper testing setup is crucial for catching issues early

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Implement backend proxy server for API requests
- [ ] Connect frontend components to real APIs
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Create automated tests for API integration

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: Completed
- Phase 3: Completed
- Phase 4: In Progress

## Lessons Learned
- Include debug information in API responses for easier troubleshooting
- Always validate API inputs on both client and server sides
- Test with real APIs early to identify integration issues
- Consider rate limiting and caching from the beginning
- Implement comprehensive error handling for storage operations
- Use version control for cache to handle schema changes
- Implement proper cleanup for expired cache entries
- Consider storage quota limitations when caching data
- Implement secure key management with encryption and rotation
- Add monitoring and alerts for key rotation
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Organize code by features rather than technical layers for better maintainability
- Co-locate related code to improve developer experience
- Use READMEs to document code organization and architecture decisions

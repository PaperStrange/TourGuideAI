# TourGuideAI Project

## Project Overview
A personal tour guide web application with three main pages:
- Chat page for generating travel plans
- Map page for visualizing routes and nearby points of interest
- User profile page for managing generated routes

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Front page generation and Basic element render & API integration and all Function calls
- [X] Generate 3 main pages with all required elements
  - [X] Chat page (6 elements, 2 function calls)
  - [X] Map page (3 elements, 5 function calls)
  - [X] User profile page (3 elements, 2 function calls)
- [X] Configure pages based on JSON specification files
- [X] Implement all required function calls

### Phase 2: API data mock and testing & UI interface testing
- [X] Deploy locally (Alternative: Code-based review due to missing Node.js)
- [X] Test all rendered web elements
- [X] Verify implementation of interactive requirements
- [X] Refine and rectify issues

### Phase 3: Collaborative acceptance check
- [ ] Show interactive website in browser
- [ ] Collaborate with user to fix issues
- [ ] Polish the project until completion

## Learnings
- Used React for building a component-based UI
- Implemented mock API functions to simulate OpenAI and Google Maps API calls
- Created responsive design for all pages
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Implemented interactive elements like sorting and filtering
- When Node.js is not available, alternative testing approaches can be used
- Documentation is crucial for tracking progress and verifying requirements

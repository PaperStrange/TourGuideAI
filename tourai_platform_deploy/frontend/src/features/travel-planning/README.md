# Travel Planning Feature

This feature handles the travel itinerary planning functionality, allowing users to generate and customize travel plans.

## Components

- **ItineraryBuilder**: Interface for customizing and fine-tuning travel itineraries
- **RouteGenerator**: UI for generating travel routes from user queries
- **RoutePreview**: Quick preview of generated routes

## Services

- **RouteGenerationService**: Handles communication with OpenAI for route generation
- **RouteManagementService**: Manages saving, editing, and updating routes

## Functionality

- Customization of generated itineraries
- Generation of personalized travel routes
- Natural language processing of travel queries
- Saving and managing travel plans

## Performance Optimizations

- **API Caching**: Generated routes are cached to prevent unnecessary API calls
- **Background Processing**: Heavy computations run in separate threads when possible
- **Compression**: Route data uses LZ-string compression for efficient storage
- **Dynamic Loading**: Components load on-demand using React.lazy and Suspense
- **Prefetching**: Common route patterns are prefetched during idle time

## Dependencies

This feature depends on:
- Common UI components (via `core/components`)
- OpenAI API (via `core/api/openaiApi`)
- Storage services (via `core/services/storage`) 

## Testing

The Travel Planning feature has comprehensive test coverage:

- **Component Tests**: Unit tests for RouteGenerator, RoutePreview, and ItineraryBuilder components
- **Service Tests**: Backend tests for RouteGenerationService and RouteManagementService
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for the complete travel planning workflow
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: End-to-end tests across different browsers and screen sizes
- **Load Tests**: Performance testing under various load conditions
